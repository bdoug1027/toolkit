# Quick Capture

> Your inbox for thoughts, tasks, and ideas

## How to Use

Just message me naturally:
- "Remind me to call John Tuesday at 2pm"
- "Note: The client mentioned they want blue branding"
- "Task: Send proposal to Acme Corp"
- "Idea: What if we offered a free audit?"
- "Research: Find competitors to [company]"

I'll parse it and route to the right place.
