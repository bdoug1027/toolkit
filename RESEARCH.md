# Research Agent

> Async deep research with reports

## How to Use

Request research naturally:
- "Research [company] - find their competitors and pricing"
- "Deep dive on [topic] for the blog"
- "Find out about [person] before our meeting"
- "What's the market size for [industry]?"

I'll work on it (often via sub-agent) and ping you when done.
