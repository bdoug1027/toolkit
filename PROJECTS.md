## How I Use This

**On session start:** I check this file to understand what's active.

**During work:** I update status, blockers, and next actions.

**Commands you can use:**
- "What are we working on?" → I'll summarize active projects
- "Update [project] status" → I'll update the tracker
- "Add project [name]" → I'll create a new project file
- "What's blocked?" → I'll list blockers across all projects
